Simple fuzzy test picker to run a unique test file or test block from the REPL instead of the whole testsuite.

## Explanation

`TestPicker` is meant to be a wrapper tool around the existing standard `Test.jl` library from Julia.
**It does not require modifying your existing tests or use a different macro, however it expects that every test file you have under your `test/` folder is self-contained!**

That means you will need to import all the required packages for every test file, as well as any relevant test tooling.

For a best understanding see this small demo:

## Install

Run

```julia-repl
] add TestPicker
```

Since it is a global tool, I would recommend installing in your global environment.

## Usage

### Activating the REPL mode

Simply running

```julia
using TestPicker
```

will load the new REPL mode into your session. You can add this line to your `startup.jl` file.

To activate the mode press `!` in a new line and you will get the following prompt:

```julia-repl
test> 
```

### Running test files

Input some fuzzy input to find the desired test file(s), e.g.:

```julia-repl
test> subdirfile
```

which will get you a fuzzy search, press enter and the file will be run under the test environment.

```julia-repl
[ Info: Executing test file /home/theo/.julia/dev/TestPicker/test/test-subdir/test-file-c.jl
```

Once executed, your original environment will be restored.

#### Running multiple files

You can select multiple files to run in the `fzf` selection with `Tab` and `Shift+Tab`.

### Running test blocks

If the character `:` appears in your query, `TestPicker` will instead look for all `@testset`s present in your `test` folder, including nested ones. Any preamble like `using Test`, `config = ...` will be run as well as long as it is before the `@testset` block.

The syntax is the following

```julia-repl
test> fuzzy-file-name:fuzzy-test-set-name
```

which will give you e.g. the following selection

```
"I am another testset  |    test-b.jl:6
"I am a testset"       |    test-a.jl:3
```

Similarly to the multiple files, you can select multiple testsets to be run and they will be run independently.

### Running other test blocks than `@testset`

You have the option to add any macro that follows the `@testset` syntax (e.g. `@testitem` from [`TestItems.jl`](https://github.com/julia-vscode/TestItems.jl)) by adding them to your environment as

```julia
ENV["TESTPICKER_NODES"] = "@testitem"
```

You can add mutltiple options, coma-separated.

```julia
ENV["TESTPICKER_NODES"] = "@testitem, @mycustomtestset"
```

Note that the environment must be set **before** calling `using TestPicker` is used.

### Repeating latest test

After running a collection of test files and/or testsets you can just repeat the same operation by calling `-`(in the samme fashion as `cd -`):

```julia-repl
test> test-a
[ Info: Executing test file /home/theo/.julia/dev/TestPicker/test/sandbox/test-a.jl
Test Summary:                                                        | Pass  Total  Time
TestPicker - /home/theo/.julia/dev/TestPicker/test/sandbox/test-a.jl |    1      1  0.0s

test> -
[ Info: Executing test file /home/theo/.julia/dev/TestPicker/test/sandbox/test-a.jl
Test Summary:                                                        | Pass  Total  Time
TestPicker - /home/theo/.julia/dev/TestPicker/test/sandbox/test-a.jl |    1      1  0.0s
```

### Inspecting test results

After running tests, the `TestSet` summary is shown but you can inspect results further with `?`.

It will show a list of the tests that errored and failed with a preview of their stacktrace.
You can edit the selected test with `Ctrl+e` or inspect the stacktrace for errored tests with `Enter`.
It is also possible to inspect the stacktrace as a list with a preview of the source when possible and
`Ctrl+e` edit the source of the current trace.

### Execution 

- All selections will be run inside a module, in a similar fashion to [`SafeTestsets.jl`]().
- Before running any selection, [`TestEnv.jl`]() `activate()` is us to mimick the `Pkg.test()` behaviour. The original environment is restored afterwards, regardless of the outcome.
- The evaluation will stop if an error happens **outside** of a testset.

## Known issues

Syntax highlighting is achieved by running `bat` within `fzf`, however
[the signals needed to detect light/dark terminal background osc10/osc11 don't work in this case](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/4317).
This means some characters may have too low contrast against the background to be readable.

The current workaround is to set a theme manually using the `BAT_THEME` environment
variable e.g. add `export BAT_THEME=GitHub` to your `~/.bashrc`
